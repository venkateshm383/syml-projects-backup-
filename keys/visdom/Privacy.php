<span id="adjust"><b  style="font-size:15px;">Additional Disclosure for Canadian Customers</b></span>
<p class="welcome-page-text">In accordance with Canadian law, we will not share information we collect about Canadian residents with any other company, except as permitted by law. Residents of Canada have
the right to request from companies conducting business in Canada, a list of all third-parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for
direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-Out or Opt-In choice for use of customers&rsquo; personal
information by third-parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide the customer with information on how to exercise their disclosure choice options.
VMS currently does not share customers&rsquo; information with any non-affiliated third-parties for marketing purposes, thus we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the thirdparties
that received their personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.
If a customer is a Canadian resident, and requests information about how to exercise their third-party disclosure choices, they must send a request to the following email address.</p>
