WP Custom Taglines allows you to specify a custom tagline for each post or page that will override the sitewide tagline for that post or page.
== Description ==

WP Custom Taglines adds a meta box to your posts and pages with two options, Enable Custom Tagline, and Custom Tagline Content. Checking 
"Enable Custom Tagline" will cause your site to display the contents of the "Custom Tagline Contents" field on your site when that post or 
page is viewed, instead of the sitewide tagline.
